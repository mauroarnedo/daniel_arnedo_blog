# Daniel L. Arnedo Blog

This project was made for the mentioned artist who lives in Tucuman, Argentina.

It was worked using the **react-slick** tool for the slide displayed on the home page, **react-zoom-pan-pinch** to perform the zoom action on the artist's work when the user accesses by desktop computer, as backend the **Firebase** platform and styled with **React-Bootstrap**, **Bootstrap** and **Bootstrap-Icon**.

It has additionally dark and light mode.

Soon I will be making a dashboard for the artist in which he can manage his content and also the possibility to display more than one language.
